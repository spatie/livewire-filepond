[Filepond](https://pqina.nl/filepond/) is a powerful JavaScript library to upload files.

This repository contains a Livewire component that allow you to use Filepond easily in your  projects.

Here's an example of how you can use it in your views:

```bladehtml
<x-filepond::upload wire:model="file" />
```

Here's how it looks like in action in [mailcoach.app](https://mailcoach.app) (a product we built at Spatie):

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/livewire-filepond
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="livewire-filepond-views"
```

## Usage

First, add the scripts to your layout or view where you want to use Filepond:

```bladehtml
@filepondScripts
```

Next, add the `WithFilePond` trait to your component:

```php
use Livewire\Component;
use Spatie\LivewireFilepond\WithFilePond;

class MyLivewireComponent extends Component
{
    use WithFilePond;
    
    public $file;
}
```

Finally, add the component to your view:

```bladehtml
<x-filepond::upload wire:model="file" />
```

### Customizing the component

Optionally, you can use these component properties to customize the component:

- `multiple`: Allow multiple files to be uploaded. Default: `false`.
- `required`: Make the file input required. Default: `false`.
- `disabled`: Disable the file input. Default: `false`.
- `placeholder`: Placeholder text for the file input. Default: `Drag & Drop your files or <span class="filepond--label-action"> Browse </span>`.

Additionally, you can also pass [any property that the Filepond component accepts](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/instance/properties/). Make sure to use kebab case the property. For example, to set the maximum number of files to 5, you can do this:

```bladehtml
<x-filepond::upload wire:model="file" max-files="5" />
```

Localization automatically works based on the current locale. If you want to customize the language, you can publish the language file using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="livewire-filepond-translations"
```

If you want to change your locale you can do so by change the `.env` file:

```env
APP_LOCALE=id # change to Indonesian for example
```

or by setting the locale using laravel's `App` facade: 

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;

App::setLocale('id'); // change to Indonesian for example
```
The last method can be used to change the locale on the fly. Like when a user changes the language (You need to implement this yourself).

## Publishing assets

Livewire Filepond automatically loads the scripts through an endpoint. If you want to serve the assets directly, you can publish them:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=livewire-filepond-assets --force
```

To keep the assets up to that at all times, you can add the command above to your Composer's `post-update-cmd` scripts.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
